### Developed on:
- Windows 10 (version 1903)  
- Pycharm Professional 2019.2  
- Python 3.7.3  
**Note:** I have written the code keeping in mind about the back compatibility with Python 2.7. However, I have tested
it on Python 3.7.3 only. If you find any difficulties in executing the code on any other version, try using a virtual 
interpreter of python 3.7.3 or report the error to me for resolution.
